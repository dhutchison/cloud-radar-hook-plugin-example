# cloud-radar-hook-plugin-example
A reference implementation showing how to implement a Cloud Radar plugin providing compliance rules.


This aims to implement a percentage of the rules from [cfn-nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag) as a starting point of some best practice checks that you may want to implement in a plugin.

This will include showing how to test any hooks that you are developing.
